# video2text

Python script that extracts text from a video using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It utilizes the OpenCV library for video processing and the pytesseract library for performing OCR.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- pytesseract (`pip install pytesseract`)

Please note that pytesseract requires the Tesseract OCR engine to be installed on your system. Make sure to install Tesseract OCR using the appropriate method for your operating system.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Set the path to your input video file and the desired output text file in the script:

```python
# Path to the video file
video_path = '/input/path'
# Path to the output text file
output_file = '/output/path'


Implement any necessary preprocessing techniques in the preprocess_frame function. This function allows you to resize, denoise, enhance quality, or apply other preprocessing steps to the frame.

Run the script using the following command:

Copy code
python video_text_extractor.py
The extracted text will be saved to the specified output file.
